        ans: "The influencer marketing landscape has become a lot more sophisticated in the last five years.

Professional influencers will now look to work with talent managers and agencies like SocioFusion who will help them to leverage their audience in a meaningful way, while taking care of complex campaign elements like rights management and content reuse arrangement. The way that brands use social media has also evolved. Rather than using platforms to make updates, savvy brands are using them to engage their audience and have a conversation. But this only allows brands to reach out to their existing audience. Influencer marketing means that the campaign reach is the combined audience of every influencer that is selected.",
